        <p>I come from China, doing my master’s study in Design Entrepreneurship at the Bern University of Arts in Switzerland. I got my bachelor’s degree in China in 2014, was working in Shanghai for 5 years as a visual designer.</p>
<p>
    In 2019 I decided to quit my job to continue to study because I want to learn some different ways of thinking and creation in design, art, languages, culture. Switzerland located in the center of Europe, it’s an optimal option to study diverse knowledge.</p>
<p>
    i.save is my master’s project that aims to encourage Swiss private car drivers to reduce CO2 emissions. </p>

      <a class="thereason"><h>The reason why I am developing this project? </h> </a>
    <a class="reason">
    <p>When I was a child, we have different seasons. In winter it was always cold we had a lot of snow in our town. In summer it was hot, but was acceptable we even don’t need a fanner. Spring and autumn had their different features as well. Nowadays since the rapid economic development, it brings many side-effects to our life. For example, in many places, we realize that there are only two seasons, winter and summer. Spring and Autumn are getting shorter and shorter, all of this caused by climate change. The principal part of climate change derives from CO2 emissions. As an environmentalist, I always do my best to protect the environment because I miss the overt seasons. Meanwhile, I want to leave a healthy environment for my late generations, at least I hope they will know in some places we have different seasons on our planet. Since I study in Switzerland, I had some casual talks with Swiss people. They also think climate change has an impact too much on the Alps and creatures in the mountain. While being a designer, I think I should contribute my skills to encourage people to reduce CO2 emissions. Combined with my original intention to learn to know the culture, new mentality, new language, design method, I decided to do the project in Switzerland.</p>
    <p>
    From the statistics from FOEN, excluding air transportation, 32% of the total emissions in Switzerland are caused by transportation. Private cars generate 20% CO2 emissions, the highest of all in road transport.</p>
    <p>
    Therefore, I would like to develop a project that raises awareness for private car drivers. With this incentive in my mind, I would like to propose car insurance pay by Kilometers combined with telematics technology to make people know the amount of cO2 emissions they produced each driving. When people have a rough number in mind, I believe some of them will try to drive less. Even not all of them will do that, but they can also do something else as compensation for the environment, for example, to use less plastic products or to eat less meat. Of course, my intention is not to convince all the drivers to reduce driving, but I hope at least it can impact some people.</p>
